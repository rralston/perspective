# Perspective

This application was built for the Techcrunch Hackathon 2014. There was a positive response from the judges. 

## What does it do?

The application has a hard coded list of current events, when you select an event it displays the key countries involved in the issue. When you select a country it dynamically pulls the most recent news articles published in that country and then runs the articles through a keyword analysis to determine sentiment. Articles with a score of -1 to 0.3 are negative, between -0.3 and 0.3 are neutral articles, and 0.3 to 1.0 are positive articles. It then colour codes the articles so you can see at a glance the overall position of the media from that country. 

This application is interesting as it allows you to detect bias and sentiment from a country, and can even detect unstated support / opposition on a global issue.
